[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1 
<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - EASY TO USE BUT UNDERNEATH ITS ASSEMBLY BASED AND TRANSLATED <br>

<em>**Data Type**</em> - PIECE OF INFORMATION <br>

<em>**Variable**</em> - NAME AND THE DATA IT CONTAINS <br>

<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - A LOCAL VARIABLE IS DECLARED BY STARTING THE NAME. A CONTANSTANT VARIABLE IS DECLARED BY CAPITALIZING EVERY LETTER IN THE NAME. A GLOBAL VARIABLE IS DECLARED BY STARTING THE VARIABLE WITH THE $. THE DIFFERENCE IS IN HOW YOU WRITE THEM. <br>

<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - DEFINED BY A METHOD DEFINITION OR BLOCK, ACCESSES VARIABLES <br>

<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - DECLARED BY CAPITALIZING EVERY LETTER IN THE VARIABLE NAME <br>

<em>**Method**</em> - PRE-DEFINED CODE LINES WITH A PURPOSE <br>

<em>**IRB**</em> - RUBY SANDBOX <br>

<em>**Operators**</em> - EVALUATE MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS <br>

<em>**Class**</em> - OBJECTS <br>

<em>**Gem**</em> - OPEN SOURCE RUBY LIBRARIES, TOOLS <br>

## Part 2
<em>**Conditional**</em> -
    if then statement 
    conditional block always starts with if <br>

<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> - 
    if something is true/false then it will execute
    if somethig does not execute then eslif will execute
    else - if all other senarios fail else will execute <br>

<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - 
    case gets a variable that accepts a value then,
    a when key words with a value
    case statements check to see if the case statement equals the when value 
    ends with an else statement for when no case can be found <br>

<em>**What is a data structure? </em> -
    specific way to structure, organize, and access data (arrays, hashes) <br>

<em>**Arrays**</em> - 
    ordered list in square brackets <br>

<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - 
    methods that are already created, can be found in Ruby docs <br>

<em>**Loops**</em> - 
    is a way to execute code block repeatedly as long as a condition as a met <br>
    will stop once condition is false

<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - 
    loops that will never be false
    eventually your code will break once loops has gone some many times<br>

## common built in arrays = 
pop - removes last element of array
push - add value to the end of the array
join - combines all elements of the array as a string
length - returns the number elements in an array
each - iterates through the array with reference to each element
    arrayName.each do |name|
    puts "My name is #{name}"
    end
